-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
require('lazy').setup({
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'tpope/vim-sleuth', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} },
  { 'f-person/git-blame.nvim', opts = {} },
  { import = 'custom/plugins' },

  -- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
  -- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
  --    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
  --
  -- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
  { -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
    'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
    opts = {
      signs = {
        add = { text = '+' },
        change = { text = '~' },
        delete = { text = '_' },
        topdelete = { text = '‾' },
        changedelete = { text = '~' },
      },
    },
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
    'folke/which-key.nvim',
    event = 'VimEnter', -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
    config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
      require('which-key').setup()
    end,
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin
  --
  --

  -- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
  { 'folke/todo-comments.nvim', event = 'VimEnter', dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }, opts = { signs = false } },

  -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
  -- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
  -- place them in the correct locations.

  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
  require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
